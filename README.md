# Physics Simulation in Haskell

2d Physics Simulation using Verlet integration implemented in Haskell.
This project is inspired by the work of
[johnBuffer's Writing a Physics Engine from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS_qeBy3aQI)
and the corresponding [Github repo](https://github.com/johnBuffer/VerletSFML).

This also serves as my final project for the course
[CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html).
My solutions to the assignments and homework in the course is [here](https://github.com/beekill95/cis_194_intro_to_haskell).
